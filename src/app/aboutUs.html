            Freshly started in 2016, we are a collective focused on lifestyle, art, music, and event management.
            <br>
            With a specialist in art, music, and people, SHANDEEZ COLLECTIV works to keep the spirit of the party alive and pumps vibes into your night.
            <br><br>
            Currently, we are bringing the energy to No. 18 in Chinatown, where we hold a monthly dance party.
            <br>
            With private karaoke rooms, a main dance floor, and a stacked bar, we have the flexibility to host private celebrations and public shenanigans.
            <br><br>
            Nonetheless, our endeavors are endless.
            <br>
            Shandeez is not bound to a dictionary definition, just as the collectiv is limitless in who we are.
