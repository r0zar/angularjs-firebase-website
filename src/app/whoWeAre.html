            <h3>M. Burns</h3>
            <p>has always loved the nightlife scene of Chicago and the people she meets along the way. While studying at Lake Forest College she met a core group of party goers and music lovers. The party scene at Lake Forest emerged into a family atmosphere. The strong support of the FAM base and loyal party goers, brought M.Burns into the industry.  Moving to Chicago with members of the party fam led to the formation of Shandeez Collectiv in March 2016. M. Burns strives to give all party goers the best Chicago nightlife experience possible. </p>

            <p>also known as Sipho Ntshangase is one of the Collectiv’s main DJ but also acts as an integral part of event planning and business scheming. Ohpis started off playing for college and basement parties, but with a higher demand and interest, he furthered his gig experience in the local bar scene. After graduating college, Ohpis moved into the city of Chicago and formed Shandeez Collectiv. He curates his set to fit the vibe of the crowd. Ohpis’s musical preferences revolve around trap, house and hip hop but alternative forms of genre influences his sets to keep the party entertained and guessing for more.</p>
